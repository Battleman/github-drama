# Contributing to github-drama #
This is a curated collection of "dramatic" github interactions.

## What qualifies as drama? ##
There's no agreement on what's considered dramatic enough to be included
in github-drama. Everyone has a different sense of humor. There are plenty
of "non-serious" github threads, ones where the usual github politeness
gave way to reaction gifs and one-word replies, ultimately turning into
something like a 4chan thread without the wit.

In this repository, we'll go by the general guideline: if one or more people
in the thread appears to be getting really worked up about something, it
should be considered for inclusion here.
