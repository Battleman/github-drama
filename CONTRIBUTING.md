# Contributing to github-drama #
This is a curated collection of "dramatic" github interactions.

## What qualifies as drama? ##
There's no agreement on what's considered dramatic enough to be included
in github-drama. Everyone has a different sense of humor. There are plenty
of "non-serious" github threads, ones where the usual github politeness
gave way to reaction gifs and one-word replies, turning into something like
a 4chan thread but less funny.

This repository follows the guideline that if anyone in the thread appears to
be getting worked up about something, it can be considered for inclusion here.
