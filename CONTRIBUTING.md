## What qualifies as drama? ##
There's no agreement on what's considered dramatic enough to be included
in github-drama. Everyone has a different sense of humor. There are plenty
of "non-serious" github threads, where the usual github politeness gave
way to reaction gifs and one-word replies, turning into something like a
4chan thread but less funny.

This repository follows the guideline that if anyone in the thread appears to
be getting worked up about something, it can be considered for inclusion here.
If a repository's maintainer has locked conversation on a thread, that's also
a good indicator that it could be included here.
